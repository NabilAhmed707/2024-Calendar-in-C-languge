This C program is a console-based calendar generator for the year 2024. The user is prompted to input a month number, and the program then displays a calendar for that specific month. The program uses a switch statement to determine the number of days in the selected month and the starting day of the week. It then prints a formatted calendar with days of the week arranged accordingly. The program uses the conio.h header for the getch() function, which waits for a key press before exiting. The code could be enhanced by incorporating error handling for invalid inputs and adopting more modern practices for portability and readability. Additionally, the conio.h header is not standard and might not be available on all systems.
